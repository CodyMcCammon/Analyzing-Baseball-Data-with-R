1.) (Which datafile?)

This chapter has given an overview of the Lahman database, the Retrosheet game logs, the Retrosheet  play-by-play files, and the PITCHf/x database. Describe the relevant data among these four databases that can be used to answer the following baseball questions.

a.) How has the rate of walks (per team for nine  innings) changed over the history of baseball? 
6t
b.) What fraction of baseball games in 1968 were shutouts? Compare this fraction with the fraction of cshutouts in the 2012 baseball season.

c.) What percentage of first pitches are strikes? If the count is 2-0, what fraction of the pitches are strikes?

d.) Is it easier to steal second base or third base? (Compare the fraction of successful steals of second base with the fraction of successful steals of third base.)

___

4.) (Retrosheet Play-by-Play Record)

One of the famous plays in Philadelphia Phillies baseball history is second-
baseman Mickey Morandini’s unassisted triple play against the Pirates
on September 20, 1992.15 The following records from the Retrosheet
play-by-play database describe this half-inning. The variables indicate
the half-inning (variables INN CT and HOME ID), the current score (vari-
ables AWAY SCORE CT and HOME SCORE CT), the identities of the pitcher
and batter (variables BAT ID and PIT ID), the pitch sequence (variable
PITCH SEQ), the play event description (variable EVENT TEX), and the run-
ners on base (variables BASE1 RUN and BASE2 ID).

5. (PITCHf/x Record of Several Pitches)

R. A. Dickey is one of the current pitchers who predominantly throws
a knuckleball. The following gives some PITCHf/x variables for the first
knuckleball and the first fastball that Dickey threw for a game against the
Kansas City Royals on April 13, 2013.


start_speed end_speed pfx_x pfx_z px pz sz_bot sz_top
73 66.3 -0.64 -7.58 -0.047 2.475 1.5 3.35

81.2 75.4 -4.99 -7.67 -1.99 2.963 1.5 3.43


Describe the differences between the knuckleball and the fastball in terms
of pitch speed, movement (horizontal and vertical directions), and location
in the strike zone. Based on this data, why is a knuckleball so difficult for
a batter to make contact?
